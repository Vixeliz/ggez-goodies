Useful modules for the ggez Rust game framework.

Each module is meant to be pretty much self-contained without relying on the others.
Or if it does rely on others, it will be in a strictly incremental fashion.

Currently this is very incomplete but hopefully semi-useful.  If nothing else it should be a good place to
start for making your own versions of the same tasks.

# Modules:

 * Input indirection layer and state tracking
 * Scene manager
 * Camera
 * Particle system (incomplete)

# Modules to create

 * Sprites with ordering, animation, atlasing, tile mapping, 3x3 sprites... (look at
   https://docs.rs/piston2d-sprite/0.28.0/sprite/index.html) (also look at XNA's sprite system, FNA's implementation of such,
   Godot, *Cocos2D*)
 * GUI (conrod? imgui? ozkriff's ggez-zgui?)
 * In-game debugger...?

# Useful goodies made by other people

 * specs for entity-component system (alternatives: ecs or recs or rustic-ecs crates)
 * cgmath, nalgebra or vecmath for math operations
 * physics/collision???  ncollide.
